# Recipe Finder

This is a simple web application that allows users to find recipes based on ingredients using the Edamam API.

## Usage

## API Integration

To make this recipe finder work, you'll need to obtain an API key from Edamam.

1. Sign up for an account on the [Edamam Developer Portal](https://developer.edamam.com/).

2. Create a new application and get your `APP_ID` and `APP_KEY`.

3. Replace `'YOUR_APP_ID'` and `'YOUR_APP_KEY'` in the `script.js` file with your actual Edamam API credentials.
