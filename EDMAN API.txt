Hello fellow developers,

I hope you are having a great day and enjoying the fruits of your hard work. I am writing to you to share some important information about the Edamam API that we are using in this project.

As you know, the Edamam API is a powerful tool that allows us to access nutrition data for any food or recipe. It can help us create amazing features for our users, such as calorie tracking, diet planning, recipe analysis, and more.

However, to use the Edamam API, we need to have valid credentials that identify us as authorized developers. Each of us has our own unique app ID and app key that we obtained from the Edamam website. These credentials are essential for making requests to the API and getting the data we need.

Therefore, I kindly request you to use your own Edamam API credentials in this project and not mine. I have used mine while developing, but they are not meant to be shared with others. You can use yours by replacing 'YOUR_APP_ID' and 'YOUR_APP_KEY' with your actual Edamam API credentials in the code.

This way, we can avoid any potential issues with the API usage limits, privacy policies, or terms of service. We can also ensure that our project runs smoothly and efficiently without any interruptions or errors.

Additionally, I would like to emphasize that this beginner-level project is open for contributions! We encourage you to explore different styles and ideas to make it visually appealing and user-friendly. Your creativity and input are highly valued, and I will be truly thankful for your contribution.

Thank you for your cooperation and understanding. I appreciate your dedication to this project, and I look forward to seeing the final product. If you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to contact me anytime.

Happy coding!
